server-configs
==============

The server used for the Pedal Portland Application uses three key components for its development.

For data aggregation, we use [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org) for its ease of use and excellent post gis extension. ([Setup](PostgresInstall.md))

For our agile development style, we maintain an [Icescrum](http://www.icescrum.org/en/) service. ([Setup](./IcescrumInstall.md))
